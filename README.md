# 🌍 Flag Guessing Game (Python Turtle)

A fun and educational **flag guessing game** built with Python’s `turtle` graphics module. The program randomly displays a country’s flag, and the player must guess which country it belongs to.

---

## 🎮 How the Game Works

* A flag is drawn using the **turtle graphics window**
* You type the country name in the terminal
* You start with **4 lives**
* Correct guesses earn points
* Wrong guesses cost a life
* Each flag appears only once per game

At the end, your performance is rated as **Good**, **Average**, or **Bad** based on your score.
